Why?</h2>\n<p>When people first start a blog, they mainly use platform services such as Naver and Tistory. Of course, because it is accessible and easy to write. However, as time goes on, I am skeptical of the low-quality writing that is rife on these platforms.</p>\n<p>For this reason, recently, more and more users are moving to platforms such as brunch and Medium. On the other hand, developers or users with experience in development often create and use their own blogs. There are various reasons for this, but typically, there is a desire to control/control by oneself, and it seems that there is a lot of interest in using the FrontEnd technology at the same time as the blog itself.</p>\n<p>In my case, I mainly write articles using Markdown. I wrote in Google Docs and wrote in memo apps such as Notion, but it was floating around without being settled properly. Then I thought that the fragments scattered from one service to another were wasteful. For this reason, I wanted to make a markdown file into a blog, so I started making my own blog.</p>\n<h2 id=\"\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#\" aria-label=\" permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<h2 id=\"jam-stack---static-website-generator\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#jam-stack---static-website-generator\" aria-label=\"jam stack   static website generator permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>JAM Stack - Static Website Generator</h2>\n<p>I think the reasons for each individual are infinitely different. In any case, the reader of this article will also have decided to create their own blog. If so, now you have to build/distribute the website, and the concept of web, server application, and DB built in the form of WEB/WAS/DB as in the past comes to mind. As will be discussed later, this is a method of processing dynamic data in the server side (SSR: Server Side Rendering), in which the server is responsible for most of the operations, and the client only outputs the result.</p>\n<p>As the previous generation technology, the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack using Apache is a representative SSR-oriented architecture. However, this method has a lot to take in building a personal blog, and the technology stack itself is a specification technology, so it is a bit difficult to apply to a new blog. In particular, since an application server that directly controls the DB such as PHP/MySQL is used, there are many items to be concerned about in security, and I think that computing resources are a bit wasteful for the purpose. Blog platforms such as Naver/Tistory operate this structure on a commercial scale.</p>\n<p>The most commonly used web service architecture recently is MEAN (MongDB, Express, AngularJS, Node JS) Stack. It is also called MERN Stack by changing AngularJS to ReactJS. However, this also includes DB. Although it is a dynamic story, it requires DB management. I create a personal blog to write and manage articles comfortably, but I do not have time to manage the DB. It will be in the form of not knowing whether you are writing an article or managing the DB.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/62f9bc8d24479c59f6ebe4d0438698d7/6af66/image-20210601172512392.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 79.05405405405406%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"image-20210601172512392\"\n        title=\"image-20210601172512392\"\n        src=\"/static/62f9bc8d24479c59f6ebe4d0438698d7/fcda8/image-20210601172512392.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/62f9bc8d24479c59f6ebe4d0438698d7/12f09/image-20210601172512392.png 148w,\n/static/62f9bc8d24479c59f6ebe4d0438698d7/e4a3f/image-20210601172512392.png 295w,\n/static/62f9bc8d24479c59f6ebe4d0438698d7/fcda8/image-20210601172512392.png 590w,\n/static/62f9bc8d24479c59f6ebe4d0438698d7/6af66/image-20210601172512392.png 640w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>In this regard, recently, another architecture called JAM (Javascript, API, Markup) Stack has been frequently discussed.

All you need is internet storage/storage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reference:  <a href=\"https://jamstack.org/why-jamstack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://jamstack.org/why-jamstack/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Simply speaking, JAM Stack is all about loading the markup file (including HTML) stored on the Internet and displaying it in the user's (Client) browser. If you think about it simply, you can see that the HTML file in the network storage is opened with a browser. End.</p>\n<p>There is no complicated process of receiving user information (login), managing the session, storing it in the DB, calculating it dynamically, and sending it back to the user. It just shows the already created (Static Web). However, when creating the content (Static Web Content) to be shown to the user in this process, all the number of cases is created, and Javascript and API are used in this process.</p>\n<p>Because of this concept, an essential element is a web repository (repository), and a service is possible. Since there is no user input, no session management, etc., there is little to say about security. Since the content of the static website is already publicly available, it is not something to keep secret.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In short, you only need to upload the file to AWS S3 and display it as a website. (The key is how you create the static file.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conversion of content containing confidential information into static content must be managed. Typically, management is required so that passwords, keys, and tokens are not disclosed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Considering these contents, it is natural, but the following characteristics are selected.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fast performance: Server-side computation has already been completed in the content production process. File transfer is everything.</li>\n<li>High Security: As already mentioned, there is no such thing as security. It's all publicly available.</li>\n<li>Cost-effectiveness and scalability: The service is available only with network storage or CDN.</li>\n<li>Operational Efficiency: There is not much to manage during operation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although I dared to mention it, it is only natural that static files are publicly available on the Internet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"static-website-generator\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#static-website-generator\" aria-label=\"static website generator permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Static Website Generator</h3>\n<p>But, at this point, you might be wondering.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-how-do-you-turn-a-blog-post-into-a-static-web-file-you-dont-have-to-create-html-for-yourself-do-you\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#so-how-do-you-turn-a-blog-post-into-a-static-web-file-you-dont-have-to-create-html-for-yourself-do-you\" aria-label=\"so how do you turn a blog post into a static web file you dont have to create html for yourself do you permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>\"So, how do you turn a blog post into a static web file? You don't have to create HTML for yourself, do you?\"</h3>\n<p>Of course not. For this reason, what you need is a Static Website Generator. It means that I write my blog posts dynamically, but from time to time I make my posts into static files (ie HTML, CSS, JS files). It is a method of generating the number of all cases processed in the existing dynamic web application (Server Side Rendering, SSR: Server Side Rendering) in advance and making it into HTML. In a way, it may be a really ignorant method, but it seems that this approach has been created as the computing power of the user (client) has improved.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since there are various cases, in order to manage this, the data is managed separately. Usually, the content is separated into a JSON file, and the API is used in the process of loading the JSON file.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, the core of the JAM Stack can be said to be a static website generator.</p>\n<p>Typical examples of static website generators include Jekyll, Hugo, and Gatsby. Also, Git Pages of Github is a representative repository that serves such a static website. Therefore, we can run a personal blog by uploading only html files to the Git page. ^^;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Github has Jekyll preloaded. Therefore, when jekyll-based source code is uploaded, jekyll internally creates a static file.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Among the many static website generators, I <code class=\"language-text\">Gatsby</code>chose . This part will depend on your personal circumstances. Each technology has its pros and cons, so you should choose one that suits you. A brief summary of the features is as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Jekyll: Github built-in</li>\n<li>Hugo : Based on the latest language Go language, fast build</li>\n<li>Gatsby: Based on ReactJS.

The rest is the degree of difference in settings for each service. First of all, I plan to post content by saving the content to the Git Page. Using Git Page means that Github and Gatsby Cloud (repository) are integrated into one in the figure above.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Netlify services will be added in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, since Headless CMS can be applied later, I plan to write an article on a local PC for now. I have tried several Headless CMS, but I do not think that it is more convenient than the existing platform blog, so the introduction of Headless CMS is postponed.</p>","excerpt":"Chapter 1.
